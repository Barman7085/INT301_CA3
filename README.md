Introducing Volatility-

Volatility is an open source framework used for memory forensics and digital investigations. The framework inspects and extracts the memory artifacts of both 32-bit and 64-bit systems. The framework has support for all flavours of Linux, Windows, MacOS and Android. It can analyse raw memory dumps, crash dumps, virtual machine snapshots, VMware dumps (.vmem), Microsoft crash dumps, hibernation files, virtual box dumps, and many others. The framework is intended to investigate the systemâ€™s state independently and consists of over 35 plugins for analysing. Volatility is available as pre-installed binaries in several Linux flavours such as REMnux, Kali Linux, etc. It is freely available in Git (https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility).
